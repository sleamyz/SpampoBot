# SpampoBot
The Spam Police (Spampo) Bot is a discord bot that has the function of detecting spambots in discord servers; it processes user reports and message history and uses Machine Learning to identify discord profiles detected to be spambots.
Through the development of the SpampoBot, we hope that we can further expand the functionalities of the bot in the future to aid more Discord users in detecting and handling undesired spambots. 
The goal of the final experiential product is to help many discord servers provide a pleasant experience to their users, in the absence of unsolicited advertisements and spam.
